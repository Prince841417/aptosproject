# DigitalWill Smart Contract

## Vision

The **DigitalWill** smart contract allows users to create decentralized wills, ensuring that assets are securely transferred to a designated beneficiary after death or upon will execution. This system provides a transparent, automated, and tamper-proof way to manage the inheritance process on the blockchain.

## Features

- **Create a Will**:
  - Users can create a digital will by specifying a beneficiary and the assets to be transferred.
- **Execute the Will**:
  - The designated executor can transfer the assets to the beneficiary, ensuring that the will is honored.

## Future Scope

1. **Automated Will Execution**:

   - Integrate oracles to automate the execution of wills based on real-world events like death certificates.

2. **Multiple Beneficiaries**:

   - Enable the division of assets among multiple beneficiaries, allowing more complex inheritance structures.

3. **Time-Based Execution**:
   - Introduce time-based triggers for will execution, allowing assets to be distributed after a specific date.

The **DigitalWill** contract offers a secure and decentralized method for managing and executing wills, ensuring assets are transferred to the intended beneficiaries in a transparent and efficient manner.
